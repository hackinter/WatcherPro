## Project History 📖

WatcherPro was developed out of a need for a reliable and efficient tool for subdomain enumeration. The project began as a personal initiative to improve my skills in Python programming while addressing a common challenge faced by security professionals. Over time, I added features like DNS resolution, multi-threading for speed, and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

The project has evolved with contributions and feedback from the community, and it aims to continue improving based on user needs and technological advancements.
